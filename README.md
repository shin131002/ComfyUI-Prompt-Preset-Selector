## Installation

1. Navigate to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
```

2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ComfyUI-Prompt-Preset-Selector.git
```

3. (Optional) Install PyYAML if not already installed (for YAML support):
```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

Note: PyYAML is usually already installed in most environments. The node will display a warning if YAML files cannot be loaded.

4. Restart ComfyUI

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Add the **"Prompt Preset Selector"** node to your workflow
2. **Option A**: Select a preset file from the dropdown (e.g., `camera_angles.txt`)
   **Option B**: Enter an absolute path in the `absolute_path` field (e.g., `/home/user/my_presets/styles.yaml`)
3. Choose an execution mode
4. Connect the `text` output to your prompt node

**Note**: If `absolute_path` is provided, it takes priority over the `preset_file` dropdown.

### Using Absolute Paths

You can use preset files from anywhere on your system:

```
/home/user/presets/camera_angles.txt
/mnt/shared/prompts/styles.yaml
C:\Users\YourName\Documents\presets\lighting.yml  (Windows)
```

Supported file types: `.txt`, `.yaml`, `.yml`

### YAML File Formats

This node supports three YAML formats:

#### Format A: Presets List
```yaml
presets:
  - front view, low-angle shot, close-up
  - back view, low-angle shot, close-up
  - side view, eye-level shot, medium shot
```

#### Format B: Flat List
```yaml
- front view, low-angle shot, close-up
- back view, low-angle shot, close-up
- side view, eye-level shot, medium shot
```

#### Format C: Nested Dictionary
```yaml
camera_angles:
  close_up:
    - front view, low-angle shot, close-up
    - back view, low-angle shot, close-up
  wide_shot:
    - front view, high-angle shot, wide shot
    - back view, high-angle shot, wide shot

lighting:
  natural:
    - golden hour lighting, warm tones
    - overcast daylight, diffused light
  studio:
    - three-point lighting, neutral balance
```

**Important**: In Format C, key hierarchy is prepended to each preset:
- Becomes: `camera_angles:close_up: front view, low-angle shot, close-up`
- This allows searching by keys: `camera_angles:` or `close_up:` or `"camera angles":"close up"`
- Keys with spaces must use quotes in YAML: `"camera angles":`

All formats are automatically flattened into a single list of presets.

### Execution Modes

**Manual**
- Uses `preset_index` directly
- Good for testing specific presets

**Sequential**
- Starts from `preset_index`, increments each execution
- Resets to `preset_index` when workflow is reloaded

**Sequential (continue)**
- Continues from last position across executions
- Persists state until workflow is reloaded
- Useful for generating batches

**Random**
- Selects random preset based on `seed`
- Same seed = same result (reproducible)

### Keyword Filtering

Filter presets using powerful keyword search:

#### Basic Modes
- **OFF**: No filtering (use all presets)
- **AND**: Match ALL keywords
- **OR**: Match ANY keyword

#### Syntax

**Simple Keywords**:
```
front                → Lines containing "front"
front close-up       → AND: both "front" AND "close-up"
front, back          → OR: "front" OR "back"
```

**Phrase Search** (use double quotes):
```
"low-angle shot"     → Match exact phrase
front "eye-level"    → Combine phrase and word
```

**YAML Key Hierarchy Search**:

When using nested YAML dictionaries, keys are prepended to preset text:
```yaml
camera_angles:
  close_up:
    - front view, low-angle shot, close-up
```
Becomes: `camera_angles:close_up: front view, low-angle shot, close-up`

Search by keys:
```
camera_angles:              → All presets under camera_angles
close_up:                   → All presets with close_up key (any level)
camera_angles:close_up:     → Exact path (requires space as separator in AND mode)
"camera angles":            → Keys with spaces (use quotes)
"camera angles" "close up"  → Both keys present (AND mode)
```

**Exclusion** (use minus prefix):
```
front -wide          → Include "front", exclude "wide"
front -wide -medium  → Multiple exclusions
-wide -back          → Only exclusions (remove from all)
"front view" -"wide shot" → Phrase with exclusion
camera_angles: -wide_shot:  → Key filter + key exclusion
```

#### Filtering Rules
- Keywords are **case-insensitive**
- Exclusions use **OR logic** (exclude if ANY match)
- Exclusions apply **AFTER** inclusion filtering
- **Order doesn't matter**: `front -wide` = `-wide front`
- Delimiters: comma `,` or space
- **YAML dict keys are searchable**: Use `:` suffix for key matching (e.g., `close_up:`)
- **Spaces in keys**: Use double quotes (e.g., `"camera angles":`)

#### Examples

| Keyword | Mode | Result |
|---------|------|--------|
| `front close-up -wide` | AND | Has both "front" AND "close-up", but NOT "wide" |
| `front back -medium` | OR | Has "front" OR "back", but NOT "medium" |
| `"front view" -"wide shot"` | AND | Has phrase "front view", but NOT phrase "wide shot" |
| `-wide` | OFF | All lines except those with "wide" |
| `camera_angles:` | AND | All presets under camera_angles key (YAML) |
| `"close up":` | AND | All presets with "close up" key (YAML, spaces in key) |
| `lighting: -dramatic:` | AND | lighting key presets, excluding dramatic key |

### Creating Custom Presets

#### Text Files (.txt)

1. Navigate to the `presets` folder in this node's directory
2. Create a new `.txt` file (e.g., `my_presets.txt`)
3. Add your presets, one per line:

```txt
# This is a comment - it will be ignored

front view, low-angle shot, close-up
side view, eye-level shot, medium shot
back view, high-angle shot, wide shot

# Another section
overhead view, bird's-eye view, establishing shot
```

#### YAML Files (.yaml / .yml)

Create structured preset files with YAML:

```yaml
# Nested dictionary format
camera_angles:
  close_up:
    - front view, low-angle shot, close-up
    - side view, low-angle shot, close-up
  
  medium_shot:
    - front view, eye-level shot, medium shot
    - side view, eye-level shot, medium shot
```

Or use simple list format:

```yaml
presets:
  - front view, low-angle shot, close-up
  - side view, eye-level shot, medium shot
```

4. Refresh ComfyUI or restart
5. Your new preset file will appear in the dropdown

## Preset File Format

### Text Files (.txt)
- **One preset per line**
- **Lines starting with `#` are comments** (ignored)
- **Empty lines are ignored**
- **UTF-8 encoding** supported (for international characters)

### YAML Files (.yaml, .yml)
- **Three supported formats**: presets list, flat list, nested dictionary
- **All formats are flattened** into a single preset list
- **Comments supported** using `#`
- **UTF-8 encoding** supported

Example:
```txt
# Camera Angles - Close Up Shots
front view, low-angle shot, close-up
side view, eye-level shot, close-up

# Camera Angles - Wide Shots  
front view, low-angle shot, wide shot
back view, high-angle shot, wide shot
```

- `lighting -dramatic` → Prompts containing "lighting" but not "dramatic"

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Record successful prompts with dates
- ✅ Easily generate variations with the same settings
- ✅ Review what worked well later
- ✅ Share good prompts with your team

Systematically manage your past successes and streamline your creative workflow!

### Camera Angle Variations
Generate systematic camera angle variations with filtering:
```
Keyword: "close-up" -back
Mode: Sequential
→ Cycles through all close-up shots except back views
```

### Anime Character Database
Organize character prompts by series:
```yaml
anime:
  shonen:
    - luffy, straw hat, scar under eye, determined expression
    - naruto, blonde hair, whisker marks, orange jacket
    - goku, spiky black hair, orange gi, martial arts pose
  seinen:
    - spike spiegel, green hair, brown suit, cigarette
    - guts, black armor, huge sword, intense gaze
  slice_of_life:
    - yui hirasawa, brown hair, school uniform, guitar
```

**Search examples**:
- `anime:` → All anime characters
- `shonen:` → Only shonen characters
- `shonen: -naruto` → Shonen characters except Naruto
- `blonde -naruto` → Blonde characters excluding Naruto
- `"slice_of_life":` → Slice of life characters only

This is perfect for managing large character databases where you want to randomly select from specific categories!

### YAML-based Style Library
Organize complex style hierarchies:
```yaml
styles:
  anime:
    - vibrant colors, bold outlines, expressive eyes
    - pastel tones, soft shading, cute aesthetic
  
  realistic:
    - photographic quality, detailed textures
    - high dynamic range, natural lighting
  
  artistic:
    - watercolor effect, soft edges, dreamy atmosphere
    - oil painting style, thick brushstrokes, rich colors
```

### Absolute Path for Shared Presets
Use team-shared preset files:
```
absolute_path: /mnt/shared/company_presets/brand_styles.yaml
keyword: professional
→ Access centralized preset library
```

### Style Combinations
Randomly select styles while excluding certain types:
```txt
# styles.txt
cyberpunk style, neon lights, dark atmosphere
fantasy style, magical elements, vibrant colors
realistic style, photographic quality, detailed
minimalist style, simple shapes, clean lines
```
```
Keyword: style -minimalist
Mode: Random
→ Randomly picks any style except minimalist
```

### Clothing with Constraints
Find specific clothing types:
```
Keyword: casual -formal
Mode: OR
→ Gets casual wear, excludes any formal items
```

### LoRA Combinations
```txt
<lora:style1:0.8>, anime style, vibrant colors
<lora:style2:1.0>, realistic, detailed
<lora:style3:0.9>, watercolor, soft edges
```

**Note**: This node outputs LoRA syntax as plain text. To actually load and apply LoRAs, connect the output to a LoRA-compatible node that can parse the `<lora:name:weight>` syntax. The node itself does not process LoRA syntax—it simply provides the text for downstream nodes to handle.

## Tips

### Using preset_list Output
Connect `preset_list` to a display node to see all available presets with their indices. Useful for:
- Checking which presets match your keywords
- Finding the right `preset_index` value
- Verifying filter results

### Using selected_info Output
Shows execution details like:
```
Selected: 5: front view, eye-level shot, close-up
Mode: Sequential (continue)
Filtered: 24/96 presets
```

### Batch Generation
Use Sequential (continue) mode with keyword filtering:
1. Set keyword filter (e.g., `"close-up" -back`)
2. Choose Sequential (continue) mode
3. Queue multiple generations
→ Each generation uses the next matching preset

### Reproducible Results
For random selection:
1. Use Random mode
2. Note the seed value when you get good results
3. Use the same seed to reproduce exactly

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Empty dropdown for presets?**
A: This node uses an integer `preset_index` instead of a text dropdown. Use the `preset_list` output to see available presets.

**Q: Keywords not working?**
A: Make sure `keyword_mode` is set to AND or OR, not OFF. Check that keywords match actual text in your preset file.

**Q: Sequential (continue) mode not continuing?**
A: This mode resets when you reload the workflow. State persists only during active workflow execution.

**Q: Exclusions not working?**
A: Make sure you're using the minus prefix: `-wide` not `- wide`. No space after the minus.

**Q: YAML file not loading?**
A: Ensure PyYAML is installed: `pip install pyyaml`. Check that your YAML syntax is valid. The node supports three formats (see YAML File Formats section).

**Q: Absolute path not working?**
A: 
- Check the file exists at the specified path
- Use forward slashes `/` even on Windows (or escaped backslashes `\\`)
- Ensure file has supported extension: `.txt`, `.yaml`, or `.yml`
- Verify you have read permissions for the file

**Q: YAML nested dict returns wrong order?**
A: Python dictionaries maintain insertion order (Python 3.7+), but the flattening process extracts all values. The order depends on YAML structure traversal.
